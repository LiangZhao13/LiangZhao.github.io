- I am currently a PhD candidate in [College of Civil Engineering and Architecture](http://www.ccea.zju.edu.cn.http.jxutcmtsg.proxy.jxutcm.edu.cn/main.htm) at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/). 
- Supervised by [Prof. Yong Bai](https://person.zju.edu.cn/0010294), my current research interests include:\
**Mission/path planning for autonomous marine vehicles;\
Coverage path planning for bathymetric survey assisted by autonomous marine vehicles;\
Path design for maritime data harvesting assisted by autonomous marine vehicles;\
Advanced control for marine vehicles;**
- Priori to joining ZJU, I received my B.Eng. degree in College of Civil Engineering at Central South University in 2020.

# Research experience
## Coverage path planning (CPP) for USV-assisted coastal bathymetric survey
Featuring agile operational ability and low financial costs, unmanned surface vehicle is a desirable tool to perform bathymetric mapping for coastal regions. However, the CPP problem for bathymetry remains an ongoing challenge due to its NP-hard feature, conflicting objectives, and complex ocean environments. This research aims to design effective mathematical models and solvers to address these challenges. We use knowledge from remote sensing, optimization, robotics, and marine engineering to develop algorithms for optimal solutions. Numerical simulations and lake trials are performed to validate the effectiveness in practical applications. \
