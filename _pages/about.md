- I am currently a PhD candidate in [College of Civil Engineering and Architecture](http://www.ccea.zju.edu.cn.http.jxutcmtsg.proxy.jxutcm.edu.cn/main.htm) at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/). 
- Supervised by [Prof. Yong Bai](https://person.zju.edu.cn/0010294), my current research interests include:\
**Mission/path planning for autonomous marine vehicles;\
Coverage path planning for USV-assisted bathymetric survey;\
Path design for USV-assisted maritime data harvesting;\
Advanced control for marine vehicles;**
- Priori to joining ZJU, I received my B.Eng. degree in College of Civil Engineering at Central South University in 2020.
